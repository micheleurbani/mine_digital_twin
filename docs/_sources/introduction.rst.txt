Introduction
============

The module is used to replicate the operations and maintenance (O&M) of a mine industry. The module is written in Python and it uses the package *SimPy* to implement a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) experiment.
Different items can be modeled in our environment and in fact the environment works correctly only if we initialize at least one item of each class.

Items of the mine environment are the following:

* **Trucks**: trucks objects are based on the class :class:`Mine.Truck`. During the course of the simulation they are subject to corrective and preventive maintenance, with a cost of corrective maintenance :math:`C_c` greater than the cost of preventive maintenance :math:`C_p`.

* **Shovels**: are modeled using the class :class:`Mine.Shovel`. During the course of the simulation, they are subjected to both preventive and corrective maintenance intervention. Maintenance cost of shovels follows the assumption :math:`C_c > C_p`.

* **DumpSites**: are modeled using the class :class:`Mine.DumpSite`. They are characterized by a serving time and by a :class:`simpy.Resource` property. The serving time is a property of the dumpsite and it is specified when the dumpsite is created. The :class:`simpy.Resource` is used to manage the queue of trucks.

* **WorkShops**: are modeled using the class :class:`Mine.WorkShop`. The serving time of a workshop depends on the repair time of the item that is served. The queue of items (they could be both trucks or shovels) is managed by a :class:`simpy.PriorityResource`.

In the next section - :doc:`Get Started <get_started>` - we show how to get started with the use of the library from both MatLab and Python environment.

The documentation of the code is available at the following link :doc:`Documentation <documentation>`.
